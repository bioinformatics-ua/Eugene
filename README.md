EuGene is a synthetic gene redesign software.

It allows opening and parsing genome files, analysing gene and protein sequences, and redesigning them according to several biological factors such as codon usage, codon context, GC content, hidden stop codons, repeated codons or nucleotides, harmonisation, deleterious sequences, etc.

EuGene facilitates common tasks related to gene characterisation and manipulation, such as identifying genes and genomes, predicting protein secondary structure, showing protein tertiary structure, performing alignments with orthologs, calculating measures such as CAI and Nc, etc.

Also, as an auto-updating application, EuGene has to be downloaded only once, all updates from there on are automatic.
